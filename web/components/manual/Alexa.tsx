        <h2>One skill, one station.</h2>
        <p>
          The station name is dynamic. If you rename the station in <strong>Station settings</strong>,
          SUB/WAVE uses the new name in its confirmation and Alexa playback response. The
          <strong> invocation name</strong> is different: it belongs to the Alexa skill and stays
          fixed until you change it in the Alexa Developer Console.

        <p>
          The webhook does not send audio bytes through the Alexa request. It returns the
          HTTPS stream URL, and the Echo device retrieves that URL itself. With listener
          authentication enabled, the URL contains a short-lived HMAC-signed bearer token;
          it does not contain the station password. The token is checked by the existing
          Icecast listener-auth callback and is bound to the selected mount.

        <h2>Alexa gets temporary access, not your password.</h2>
        <p>
          When <strong>listener authentication</strong> is off, the skill returns the selected
          stream mount directly. When it is on, SUB/WAVE signs a token with the station
          password and appends it to the stream URL as Alexa starts or resumes playback. The
          password never appears in the Alexa response or URL.
        </p>
        <ul className="bs-list">
          <li>The token is bound to one mount, such as <code className="bs-code-inline">/stream.mp3</code>, and is checked by Icecast's existing URL-auth callback.</li>
          <li>Set the lifetime in <strong>Connect → Alexa → Alexa signed-stream lifetime</strong>. The available range is 1 hour to 7 days.</li>
          <li>A new token is generated for every play or resume request. Expiry is checked when Alexa connects; an already-playing stream is not cut off when the clock reaches expiry.</li>
          <li>Because the token is a bearer credential, anyone who obtains the complete temporary URL could use it until it expires. Keep endpoint and proxy logs private and choose the shortest practical lifetime.</li>

        <ul className="bs-list">
          <li>
            Set <code className="bs-code-inline">SITE_URL</code> to the public HTTPS origin,
            for example <code className="bs-code-inline">https://radio.example.com</code>.
            Do not put <code className="bs-code-inline">/api/alexa</code> in{' '}
            <code className="bs-code-inline">SITE_URL</code>; SUB/WAVE adds that path for the
            webhook and adds the selected stream mount for playback.
          </li>
          <li>
            The origin must be reachable from the internet on HTTPS port 443 and present a
            certificate trusted by Amazon. A Cloudflare Tunnel or another reverse proxy is
            fine when its public hostname has a valid public certificate and does not show an
            access page to Alexa.
          </li>
          <li>
            Listener authentication may stay enabled. SUB/WAVE creates a new signed Alexa
            stream URL for each play or resume request; the normal listener URL remains
            password-protected. The signed URL is a bearer credential, so do not share it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable the selected stream mount in SUB/WAVE before choosing it in the Alexa
            panel. MP3 is the safest choice for Echo playback; AAC is another conventional
            Alexa option. Opus and FLAC are exposed by SUB/WAVE for capable players, but Ogg
            is not listed in Alexa's standard long-form AudioPlayer formats, so verify those
            formats on the exact device before relying on them.

        <h2>Use the template or build the model by hand.</h2>
        <p>
          The repository template is the recommended path. After generating the package, use
          <code className="bs-code-inline">ask deploy --target skill-metadata</code> to upload
          the manifest and interaction models. Do not manually recreate every intent in the
          Developer Console when you are using the package.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are building a skill by hand instead, use the Developer Console and keep the
          interaction model consistent with the endpoint's backend handlers:
        </p>
        <ol className="bs-list">
          <li>Create a <strong>Custom</strong> Alexa skill and choose the locale you will test, such as English (US).</li>
          <li>Set the invocation name to the distinctive name you chose above.</li>
          <li>Add the supported custom and built-in intents for the model you intend to deploy; the shareable package README contains the complete intent inventory.</li>
          <li>Intent names must contain only letters and underscores, such as{' '}
            <code className="bs-code-inline">StartRadioIntent</code> and{' '}
            <code className="bs-code-inline">PlayRadioIntent</code>. Built-in intents keep the{' '}

            <code className="bs-code-inline">AMAZON.StopIntent</code>.</li>
          <li>Save and build the interaction model after changing the invocation name or utterances.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Do not put the invocation name into the custom intent utterances. Alexa supplies the
          invocation phrase separately; the utterance should describe the action, for example
          <code className="bs-code-inline">start the radio</code> or{' '}

        <p>
          Select <strong>My development endpoint has a certificate from a trusted certificate

        <div className="bs-callout">
          <div className="bs-eyebrow">THE CERTIFICATE FIX</div>
          <p>
            The endpoint failed when Alexa could not trust or reach the TLS certificate. The
            working setup used the public hostname, HTTPS on port 443, and a certificate from
            a public trusted certificate authority. Do not use a self-signed certificate for a
            published skill. Also make sure the certificate's hostname includes the exact
            <code className="bs-code-inline">SITE_URL</code> hostname and that the full chain is
            served by the tunnel or reverse proxy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Opening <code className="bs-code-inline">/api/alexa</code> in a browser sends a GET
          request. The skill webhook accepts Alexa's POST request, so a browser response such
          as <code className="bs-code-inline">Cannot GET /alexa</code> does not prove the
          endpoint is broken. Use the SUB/WAVE connection test or the Alexa console's test
          request instead.

        <h2>This endpoint belongs to your skill.</h2>
        <p>
          In this advanced setup, SUB/WAVE does not register your station in a shared broker or
          Alexa's public radio catalogue. Your skill points to your deployment, and your
          deployment returns its own station stream. Other people cannot use that skill merely
          because they know your stream URL; they would need access to the Alexa skill and its
          invocation. Keep the Alexa account and deployment admin credentials private.
        </p>
        <p>
          A shared public experience would be a different product: one published skill would
          need its own station directory, account or pairing model, and a way to choose which
          station each listener may access. This page documents the simpler station-owner path.
